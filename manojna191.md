### What I learned

In Html i have learned how to apply css for specific text and in CSS I have learned about after, before and how to add background colour to the image. 

```html
<bdi>insights</bdi>
```
```css
#image:before{
  background: hsl(277, 64%, 61%,0.5);
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```
